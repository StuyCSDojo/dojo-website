<h4>Introduction to Vim</h4>
<p class='condensed light a_info'>Written by Yicheng Wang on 2016-04-05</p>
<h5>What is Vim</h5>
<p>Vim stands for "vi-improved", which in turn stands for "visual
instrument-improved." It is one of the most widely used text editors on the planet. It is
a terminal based programmable editor, backed by its very own (and much hated) macro
language <i>vimscript</i>, but supports interpreters of a wide array of
scripting languages such as bash, python, ruby, perl, and lua.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Vim (or at least Vi) comes pre-installed in almost
every Linux distribution, and it is worthwhile for everyone to at least know the
basics of Vim because it's going to come in handy sometimes down the line.</p>

<h5>Installing Vim</h5>
<p>Vi should come pre-installed in almost all linux distributions. to install
vim in ubuntu, one needs to run:</p>
<codeblock>$ sudo apt-get install vim</codeblock>
<p>For other operating systems, one can get instructions form the vim website <a
    href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">here</a></p>

<h5>Using Vim</h5>
<p>The hallmark of Vim and what distinguishes it from other text editors is its
<b>modal</b> nature. Vim operates in several modes, each with its own key
bindings and functions, here's a brief rundown of the three most basic ones:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Normal Mode</b>: The default mode that Vim is in. This is the mode
        that Vim starts in. It is also where you put in a lot of the commands
        for Vim. Commands are entered either by a key binding or by typing
        <code>:</code> in normal mode. One can enter this mode by pressing <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> in
    any of the other modes.</li>
    <li><b>Insert Mode</b>: Triggered by typing <code>i</code> in normal mode, this what
    you use to insert characters into the buffer. This is also why people are so
    confused when they smash keys and they don't appear on the screen in Vim --
    they need to be in insert mode!</li>
    <li><b>Visual Mode</b>: Triggered by typing <code>v</code> in normal mode,
        this is what you use to select text within the buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This system may seem convoluted and overtly complicated at first, but it
actually opens up so many quick key bindings by quickly switching between normal
and insert mode. It will make sense after a while, trust me.</p>
<p>But to beginners this may be very confusing, and this is perhaps best
illustrated by the simple act of exiting Vim. This is a frustration to many and
a running joke in the community, as demonstrated by the following tweet:</p>

</center>
<p>This is how you quit Vim: <code>:q!</code></p> in normal mode. The
<code>q</code> stands for "quit" and <code>!</code> stands for ignore warnings
and errors.</p>

<p>Apart from <code>q</code>, here are a few more commands to start (optional
parameters are surrounded by parenthesis, necessary parameters are surrounded by
brackets):</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Movement (Applicable in Both Normal and Visual Modes)</b></li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>h</code> Left</li>
            <li><code>j</code> Down</li>
            <li><code>k</code> Up</li>
            <li><code>l</code> Right</li>
            <li><code>$</code> Go to end of line</li>
            <li><code>^</code> Go to beginning of line</li>
            <li><code>x</code> Cut character under cursor</li>
            <li><code>s</code> Cut current character AND enter insert mode</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Visual Mode Key Bindings and Commands</b>:</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>y</code> Yanks (copies) selected text</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Normal Mode Key Bindings and Commands</b>:</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>p</code> Paste after the cursor</li>
            <li><code>P</code> Paste before the cursor</li>
            <li><code>i</code> Enter insert mode</li>
            <li><code>v</code> Enter visual mode</li>
            <li><code>o</code> Create newline and enter insert mode</li>
            <li><code>O</code> Create newline before current line and enter
                insert mode</li>
            <li><code>A</code> Go to end of current line and enter insert mode</li>
            <li><code>I</code> Go to beginning of current line and enter insert
            mode</li>
            <li><code>:w (filename)</code> Write/save</li>
            <li><code>:sp (filename)</code> Split screen horizontally, if a filename is
                provided, also opens said file</li>
            <li><code>:vsp (filename)</code> Split screen vertically</li>
            <li><code>&lt;Ctrl&gt;w [direction]</code> Switch to buffer in
                [direction] of the current one</li>
            <li><code>![shell command]</code> Execute shell command</li>
            <li><code>/[string]</code> Search for the given string</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Configuring/Personalizing Vim</h5>
