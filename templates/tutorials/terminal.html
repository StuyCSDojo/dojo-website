<h4>How to use Terminal</h4>
<p class='condensed light a_info'>Written by Brandon Lin on 2016-04-06</p>
<h5>What is Terminal?</h5>
<p>Terminal is the main navigation system within systems such as OS X and distributions of Linux. 
For Windows users, you may know Terminal as a pseudo-Command Prompt. However, the two 
systems are very different, with Terminal having a lot more capabilities. If you are a 
Linux user, Terminal will be the main application for you to get around your machine.</p>

<h5>Running Terminal</h5>
<p>Running Terminal can be done in the following fashion: <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>t</code></p>
<p>You will then be presented will something like this:</p> <!-- insert pic of terminal here --> <br>
<p>The text that appears before your cursor is known as the <b>prompt</b>. 
The default prompt will consist of your username, the name of your machine, as well as the 
current active directory (more on this later). </p>
<p>The text you will be typing into Terminal are known as <b>commands</b>. These 
commands allow you to perform various tasks in the Terminal, and we will be going 
over many of them here. Sometimes, a command may require you to specify a file 
to perform the command to, so you may need to provide <b>arguments</b> to a command if necessary.</p>

<h5>Where Are We?</h5>
<p>As mentioned before, the Terminal allows you to navigate your file system. Imagine 
the Terminal as a person in a public library. The various categories of books and, within those books,
the different chapters, represent the folders, or <b>directories</b>, in your file system.</p>
<p>So now that we have a grasp of what we do with the Terminal, let's introduce a very basic 
command: <code>pwd</code>. Enter the command like this: <codeblock>username@Linux:~$ pwd</codeblock></p>
