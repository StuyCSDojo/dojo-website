<h4>How to use Terminal</h4>
<p class='condensed light a_info'>Written by Brandon Lin on 2016-04-06</p>
<h5>What is Terminal?</h5>
<p>Terminal is the main navigation system within systems such as OS X and distributions of Linux. 
For Windows users, you may know Terminal as a pseudo-Command Prompt. However, the two 
systems are very different, with Terminal having a lot more capabilities. If you are a 
Linux user, Terminal will be the main application for you to get around your machine.</p>

<h5>Running Terminal</h5>
<p>Running Terminal can be done in the following fashion: <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>t</code></p>
<p>You will then be presented will something like this:</p> <!-- insert pic of terminal here -->
<p>The text that appears before your cursor is known as the <b>prompt</b>. 
The default prompt will consist of your username, the name of your machine, as well as the 
current active directory (more on this later). </p>
<p>The text you will be typing into Terminal are known as <b>commands</b>. These 
commands allow you to perform various tasks in the Terminal, and we will be going 
over many of them here. Sometimes, a command may require you to specify a file 
to perform the command to, so you may need to provide <b>arguments</b> to a command if necessary.</p>

<h5>Where Are We?</h5>
<p>As mentioned before, the Terminal allows you to navigate your file system. Imagine 
the Terminal as a person in a public library. The various categories of books and, within those books,
the different chapters, represent the folders, or <b>directories</b>, in your file system.</p>
<p>So now that we have a grasp of what we do with the Terminal, let's introduce a very basic 
command: <code>pwd</code>. Enter the command like this: <codeblock>username@Linux:~$ pwd</codeblock></p>
<p>This command will tell you where you currently are in your file system. For example, your usual
starting directory will be in your home directory, which should look something like : <code>/home/username</code>
<p>Many times the home directory is abbreviated as a tilde: <code>~</code>

<h5>Who's There?</h5>
<p>We often forget what files are currently in our system. To view what files and other folders are in our current directory, use the <code>ls</code> command. This command will display all the files and folders within the directory you are currently in.
<p>There are some variations of the <code>ls</code> command, with the use of <b>flags</b>:
<ul>
  <li><code>ls -l</code> Views the files in a list format, alongside other 
    properties of these files, like permissions and write times.</li>
  <li><code>ls -a</code> Views ALL files in the directory, including hidden files 
    (hidden files have a preceding <code>.</code> in their name).
</ul>

<h5>Moving Around</h5>
<p>Staying in our home directory must be boring. We would really like to move ourselves around to other folders within directories. We can accomplish this with the <code>cd</code> command. </p>
<p>Typing <codeblock>$ cd folderName/</codeblock> will navigate yourself into <code>folderName</code> and make that your current directory. We can also navigate through multiple folders at the same time: <codeblock>$ cd folder1/folder2/folder3/</codeblock></p>
<p>We also want to know how to navigate backwards in our directory system. To go one level back,
