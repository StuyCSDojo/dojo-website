Running the Flask App  How are you planning to run the app?  Locally  Unlike the Python programs that you wrote in IntroCS2, Flask apps can be run locally.  This is a great way of testing your changes before pushing them upstream.  So how would you do this?Activate the virtualenv  Open up a terminal or command prompt and move into the virtualenv directoryRun the activation scriptOn Windows, the command is: Scripts\activateOn Unix, the command is: source bin/activateRunning the App  Navigate to the git repo for the Dojo Website in the terminalRun the app via the following command: python api.pyAccessing the site  While leaving the terminal open, open up a web browser and in the address bar, enter:  127.0.0.1:5000NoteAs soon as you terminate the Python program, the site would stop functioning.Publicly  There are two main issues with running the site locally:As soon as the program gets terminated on your computer, the site becomes unavailable.It can only be accessed on your local machine (ie localhost:5000)To resolve these issues, you need to run it on a web server with 24/7 uptime.You will need to use a UNIX terminal emulator on Windows (ie Git Bash) or a terminal on UNIX systems for these commands:$ ssh <username>@dojo.stuycs.org $ cd /projects/dojo-website/app $ source ../../dojo/bin/activate $ pkill gunicorn $ ./start_server.sh
