 Preparing the Development Environment   Which Operating System Are You Using?     Windows   Note C:\Users\Username> signals that you should enter the commands afterward in the command prompt.  Install Git and clone repo    If you do not have Git installed, check the tutorial here  for instructions on installing it along with a brief introduction to git. It is recommended for you set up your ssh keys, information can be found in the git tutorial. It is also recommended for you to install a UNIX terminal such as Git Bash Create a folder for the project and clone the repo inside the directory with the following commands: C:\Users\Username> mkdir <name of directory>  C:\Users\Username> cd <name of directory>  C:\Users\Username> git clone git@github.com:StuyCSDojo/dojo-website.git      Install Python   If you do not already have Python installed, download it from here.  Anaconda Python has a few advantages:  Automatically adds itself to path Comes with multiple libraries pre-installed including the ones we need   Add Python and pip to path   If you have vanilla Python [1] installed, there is a chance that Python and/or pip is not in your path.  Open up command prompt and test if python and pip are in your path: C:\Users\Username> python --version  C:\Users\Username> pip --version    If either command gave you an error, then you need to add them to your path.   Here are the steps (You will need Administer access):  Open Control Panel Click System and Security Select System Select Advanced System Settings on the left side Click Environment Variables in the pop up window On the bottom window, click on PATH and then click Edit At the end of the bottom text box, add a semicolon followed by the path to the executable you need to add to the path.  For example: If executing python --version gave you an error: At the end of the bottom text box, add a semicolon followed by the path to the Python executable  If executing pip --version gave you an error: At the end of the bottom text box, add a semicolon followed by the path to the pip executable    Make sure you save as you close all the pop up window.  Important Remember to close the current terminal and open up a new one before trying out the next step.  Try executing the program again in the command prompt.  For example, if Python and/or pip was the issue, execute the following: C:\Users\Username> python --version  C:\Users\Username> pip --version     It is recommended that you learn how to modify the path in Windows, but there is an alternative.  At the root  of the repo, there is a directory named devUtilities where you will find a Windows script named setPath.bat.  Run the script as administrator or it would ask for admin privileges. When it prompts you for the path: If both python --version and pip --version gave you errors, enter the directory where python is  installed, a semicolon, and then directory where pip is installed  (something like C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts) If only python --version gave an error, enter the directory where python is installed  (probably C:\Python27) If only pip --version gave an error, enter the directory where pip is installed  (probably C:\Python27\Scripts)  After making the necessary changes for you, it will reboot the machine so make sure you save your work!
